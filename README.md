Hello. I'm ThomasðŸ˜ƒ

I'm a beginner game developer from japan and I'm interested in all aspects of game development.

I do not have useful skills I can offer for game dev collaboration yet, but I am down to collaborate for game jams and stuff as a programmer, artist or game designer.

If you also need any help with Japanese localazation maybe I can help!

You can reach me through DM on twitter(@thomas_koji) or discord(Thomas Koji#6100).
